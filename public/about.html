<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sai â€” a passionate developer with a growing command of Java, Python, SQL, and web technologies. I thrive on solving complex problems with clean, efficient code and love diving deep into edge cases to ensure robustness. Whether it's debugging multi-level sorting logic or optimizing interval merging algorithms, I approach each challenge with precision and persistence. I'm always eager to explore new frameworks and environments that push my skills further.</p>

<p>ðŸŽ® My journey is driven by hands-on learning and real-world application. Iâ€™m currently working on publishing my own game to the Play Store, navigating everything from payment setup to developer account logistics. I also stay sharp through coding challenges â€” chasing milestones like the 50 Days Badge on LeetCode â€” and constantly refining my skills through project-based tutorials and advanced Java content. I believe in learning by doing, and Iâ€™m always seeking ways to turn knowledge into impact.</p>

<p>ðŸš€ Beyond code, Iâ€™m fascinated by data mining, warehousing, and the broader tech ecosystem. I value clarity, actionable advice, and iterative progress â€” whether Iâ€™m building apps, troubleshooting environments, or exploring monetization strategies. My portfolio reflects not just what Iâ€™ve built, but how I think: practical, curious, and always leveling up. Thanks for stopping by â€” letâ€™s build something great together..</p>
